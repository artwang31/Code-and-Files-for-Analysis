# Data-Wrangling-Exercises

**ALL PERSONAL AND/OR UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM ALL SAMPLE DATA** 

**ALL DATA USED TO SHOWCASE DATA WRANGLING IS SAMPLE/FAKE DATA** 


This is repository that I created to showcase my ability to transform, process, merge, and tidy data for analysis in Python, R, and SQL. The repository will continue to be updated as my coding skills develop.

Skills showcased:
- Reading and importing of static data files through Python pandas and R dplyr libraries. 
- String manipulation and regex wrangling in both languages. 
- Command line coding
- Use of argparse to locate files and read files in to workspace
- clean and aggregate multiple files and output to one file
- correlation analysis
- analytics reports
- visualizations and analysis
